# Taurscribe
**High-Performance Real-Time Transcription Engine (Rust + Whisper)**

## The Vision

To build the fastest, most practical local speech-to-text application possible on consumer hardware. The goal is to rival commercial cloud services (like Wispr Flow) in latency (<300ms) while running 100% offline for privacy. It eliminates the "bloat" of Python/Electron by running on a bare-metal Rust backend.
